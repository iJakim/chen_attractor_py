Screensaver made with passion to chaotic systems and lack of opengl skills.

Requires python 3+, numpy, scipy and matplotlib.
(To create .scr file for windows screensaver: `pyinstaller --onefile --noconsole chen_1_2_0.pyw` and then change `.exe` file in \dist to `.scr`)

To exit animation press Esc button.

Special thanks to @timoreo on discord for all the performance fixes.
